 * id along with the GDB/MI input command, this is the token.
 *
 * When GDB finally gets around to responding with a GDB/MI output
 * command, it passes back the token that was supplied to it so that
 * the client can associate the GDB/MI output command with the
 * corresponding GDB/MI input command.
 *
 * From the GDB documentation:
 *   Note that for all async output, while the token is allowed by the
 *   grammar and may be output by future versions of gdb for select async
 *   output messages, it is generally omitted. Frontends should treat all
 *   async output as reporting general changes in the state of the target
 *   and there should be no need to associate async output to any prior
 *   command. 
 * In other words, asynchronous output commands will not have the token set.
