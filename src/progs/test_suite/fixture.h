/**
 * Provides functionality above and beyond the normal Test.

 *
 * It provides a standard location to read test data from the src tree.
 *
 * Any test inheriting from this test fixture will automatically
 * know where to get any necessary related data files required for testing.
 *
 * The source directory for the test case comes from,
 *   $abs_top_srcdir/progs/test_suite/data/TestName
 * Please note that TestName is a hierarchical name. See testName()
 * for more information on this.
