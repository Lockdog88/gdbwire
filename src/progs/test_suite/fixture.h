/**
 * Provides functionality above and beyond the normal Test.
 *
 * This test fixture provides a simple framework for dealing with
 * the file system while performing a unit test.
 *
 * It provides a standard location to read test data and a
 * standard location to write test data. It also provides the
 * ability to automatically copy test data from the source tree
 * to the test working directory.
 *
 * Any test inheriting from this test fixture will automatically
 * perform the copy of the test data from the source directory
 * to the destination directory in the constructor of this class.
 *
 * The source directory for the test case comes from,
 *   $abs_top_srcdir/progs/test_suite/data/TestCaseName/TestName
 * The destination directory for the test case will be,
 *   $abs_top_builddir/test_suite/TestCaseName/TestName
