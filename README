Welcome to gdbwire.

Dependencies
------------

You must have the following packages installed.
  sh
  autoconf
  automake
  aclocal
  autoheader
  flex
  bison
  gcc/g++

Preparing the configure
-----------------------

Run ./autogen.sh in the current working directory to generate the configure
script.

Running configure, make and make install
----------------------------------------

You can run ./configure from within the source tree, however I usually run
configure from outside the source tree like so,
  mkdir ../build
  cd ../build
  CFLAGS="-g -Werror" ../gdbwire/configure  --prefix=$PWD/../prefix
  make -srj4
  make install

The make install rule is optional. You can simply run make and the executables
will be in there respective build directories. 

If you like to have a silent build, and the libtool link lines are
bothering you, you can set this environment variable to suppress
libtools printing of the link line,
  LIBTOOLFLAGS=--silent

Running the testsuite
---------------------

If you want to run the test suite you have to tell the build system
to build it. This is done by passing --enable-tests on the configure line.

After you have built the test suite, you can run all the unit tests with
the command,
  ./test_suite
